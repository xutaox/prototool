Thanks for your pull request! We really appreciate all OSS efforts, big or small.

Before submitting, make sure to:

- Review the issue template at https://github.com/xutaox/prototool/blob/dev/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md for
  general guidance on filing Prototool requests.
- Run `make` to make sure all tests pass. This is functionally equivalent to the tests run on CI.

PRs will not be properly evaluated until they pass CI - we've done what we can to make this easy
to replicate locally, and we apologize if this comes across as impersonal. Our goal is to streamline
Prototool development and make sure everyone is on the same page here.

Please do not @ individual maintainers in the description! We appreciate it.
