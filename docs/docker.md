# Prototool Docker Image

[Back to README.md](README.md)

We provide a Docker image with `prototool`, `protoc`, and common Protobuf plugins pre-installed.
Most plugins are compressed with [UPX](https://github.com/upx/upx). As of this writing, the
resulting image is around 58MB. This provides a consistent environment to generate your Protobuf
stubs.

## Docker Hub

This image is hosted at [hub.docker.com/r/xutaox/prototool](https://hub.docker.com/r/xutaox/prototool).

## Usage

Bind your input directory as a volume to `/work`, and call your command, for example
`prototool generate`:

```
docker run -v "$(pwd):/work" xutaox/prototool:latest prototool generate
```

You can build on top of this image as well if you have custom requirements.

## Included

The following libraries are included. This is not meant to be exhaustive - these represent our view
of the most commonly-used, stable, maintained libraries. If you think another library should be
included, propose it in a GitHub issue and we will evaluate it, however in general we do not want
to add additional plugins - our recommendation is to instead build your own image based on
`xutaox/prototool` that adds plugins you require.

| Name | Version | Binaries |

| [yarpc] | 1.37.3 | protoc-gen-yarpc-go |

The Well-Known Types are copied to `/usr/include`. The packages `bash`, `curl`, and `git` are also
installed.

## Versioning

Images are pushed for every commit to the dev branch as the tags `xutaox/prototool:dev`,
`uber:prototool:latest`, and every minor release starting with `v1.4.0` has a tag e.g.
`xutaox/prototool:1.4.0`. Note that as opposed to the rest of Prototool, there is no breaking change
guarantee between minor releases - we do not account for breaking changes in libraries we provide
within this image, and will update them regularly on `dev`. We recommend pinning to one of the
minor release Docker image tags.

## Development

Local development commands:

```
# build the docker image
make dockerbuild
# test a built docker image
make dockertest
# build and then test
make dockerall
```

The test files are in [etc/docker/testing](../etc/docker/testing).
